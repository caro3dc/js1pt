- **Batore**, Shanelle
- **Del Castillo**, Carlos Romeo
- **Melchor**, Kurt Michael

## Contributions
Batore and Melchor were not able to commit to the repository as much due to computer problems (WiFi issues with Batore; more severe hardware issues with Melchor).

Nonetheless, I, Carlos Del Castillo, the maintainer of this repository, request that they not be graded lowly, as they have provided (through other channels) the text content of this website, as well as suggestions as to the colour scheme and overall design of the site.

I was merely responsible in encoding their ideas, and the project **would not have been possible without their help**, even though it is not shown in Github's statistics.
